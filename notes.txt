Ares-Lite is a more practical redesign of the original Ares AI. Instead of creating its own missions sets, the lite version will work with existing user defined missions and parameters. Ares-Light seeks to improve the survivability and effectiveness of assigned units while respecting the mission boundaries set by the user. 

------------------------------
Features:
------------------------------
1.) Categorize units by roles (AAW, AG, ASUW) by their payload and assigned mission. No more reference files. (NEW)
2.) Units will avoid missiles on first detection instead of last possible moment. (OLD)
3.) Updated avoidance to factor in ARH seeker heads. Units will attempt to dive and retreat outside the FOV of ARH missiles. (NEW)
4.) Avoidance behavior based on roles (EX: AAW will avoid SAMS and Ships) (OLD)
5.) Avoidance behavior is divided into two methods. (NEW)
    a.) Line of Sight avoidance - Units will attempt to fly under the radar and still approach threats. To improve fuel efficiency, units will fly at the maximum height possible while avoiding radar. Height values are pre-determined by the distance to horizon equation.
    b.) Hard avoidance - When line of sight avoidance can no longer mask a unit's approach, the unit will attempt to avoid the threat altogether.
6.) Units under Strike Missions will attempt fly under radar to avoid any detected SAMs or ships. They will "Pop-up" only when close to the target. (NEW)
7.) Units under Patrols (SEAD, Land, Anti-ship) will occasionally "Pop-up" to detect and engage targets. (NEW)
8.) Unit avoidance will only trigger on contact detection. The better the ELINT, the better the unit will perform. (NEW)
9.) Ares-Lite will command missions containing the tag "<Ares>" in the mission name. The AI will ignore any missions without the tag. (NEW)
10.) Improved retreat logic. RTB units will now factor their home base when determining retreat vector. (NEW)
11.) Missile threat datum tracking. AI will track missile threats and create "caution zones" for units. (NEW)

Installation Guide:
------------------------------
1.) Open your scenario
2.) Create Event => "Event - Load AI"
    a.) Set repeatable and active
    b.) Set Trigger as Load On Scenario
    c.) Set Lua Script Action => "Load AI"
        i.) Copy and paste the entire content of Ares-Light.lua
	ii.) On last line => initializeAresAI("Test1"), replace "Test1" with the name of side you want the AI to control.
3.) Create Event => "Event - Update AI"
    a.) Set repeatable and active
    b.) Set Trigger to 1 second regular time
    c.) Set Lua Script Action => "Update AI"
        i.) Script should have content => updateAresAI()
4.) Ares-Lite will take over any mission with name containing "<Ares>" in any order.

------------------------------
Scenario Example Summary:
------------------------------
This scenario is designed to test the effectiveness of Ares-Lite. Blue Team, under control of the AI, will be facing an assortment of high-tech air, land, and naval threats. The main objective is to destroy all priority targets while minimizing losses if possible. In order to successfully complete the mission, the AI must perform the following:

a.) Execute AAW patrol missions inside the engagement envelops of hostile SAM's and ships.
b.) Execute ASUW patrol inside hostile SAM and air cover.
c.) Execute Land Strikes against targets protected by air, land and naval threats.

Blue Team
------------------------------
Blue Team consists of 4.5 generation fighters:
a.) 16x F-15C (AMRAAM-D) => AAW Patrol
b.) 12x Rafale M (Exocet) and 6x F-15E (SDB II) => ASUW Patrol
c.) 10x F-15E (SDB II) => Land Strike
d.)  8x EA-18G (AARGM) => Sead Patrol
e.)  3x Phalcon (AEW) => Support Patrol

Red Team
------------------------------
Red Team consists of 4.5 and 5th generation fighters, backed by high tier SAMs and ships:
a.) 24x Eurofighter (AMRAAM-C5)
b.)  6x F-35B (AMRAAM-C5)
c.)  1x Arleigh Burke Destroyer BLK3 (ESSM,SM-6)
d.)  2x Type 45 Daring Destroyer (Aster-15, Aster-30)
e.)  3x David Sling SAM Battery
f.)  3x PAC-2 Patriot SAM Battery

Scoring
------------------------------
Scoring is used to determine AI performance. AI will lose or gain points based on kills and losses in the following amount:
a.) 4th/4.5 Generation Fighters => 10pts
b.) 5th Generation Fighters => 20pts
c.) Ships and SAM batteries => 40pts
d.) Priority Land Target => 10pts
e.) Radar => 10pts
f.) AEW Aircraft => 20pts
